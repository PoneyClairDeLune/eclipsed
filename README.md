# Eclipsed
ðŸ—£ The Royal Canterlot Voice for the [EventSource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource) API. Deno only.

## Naming
_I thank thee, dear Fluttershy!_

The name of this project is a reference to MLP:FiM S02E04.

## Usage
It's pretty simple, like [`Deno.upgradeWebSocket`](https://deno.land/api?s=Deno.upgradeWebSocket)! Download the latest build from releases, and import the `upgradeEventSource` method from it.

Because `EventSource` is unidirectional, you cannot receive messages from clients.

### `upgradeEventSource(Request: request)`
Upgrade an incoming HTTP request to an `EventSource` connection.

Returns an object containing the needed response body and the `EventSourceServer` socket.

```
{
	socket: EventSourceServer,
	response: Response
}
```

### `EventSourceServer`
#### `.readyState` _readonly_
A number representing the state of the connection. Possible values are `CONNECTING` (`0`), `OPEN` (`1`), or `CLOSED` (`2`).

#### `.close()`
Closes the connection, and set the `readyState` attribute to `CLOSED`. If the connection is already closed, this method does nothing.

#### `.send(data)`
Enqueues data to be transmitted, same as [`WebSocket.send()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket/send).

#### `.onclose`
Fired when an `EventSource` connection closes.

#### `.onopen`
Fired when an `EventSource` connection has established.
